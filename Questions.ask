<strong>A) Wallet Persistence & Upgrades </strong>

in a high-up folder. This way, users can delete the app and reinstall
it, or update it without losing these files. 
  A2) We need to add files above or in the home directory, and add PATH
to the 

<strong>B) How do we deal with incorrect passwords? </strong>
<strong>Current Idea:</strong> 
1. Store encrypted PrivKeys in Wallet.dat
2. Store SHA-256 x2 of PrivKeys (or just PubKeys).
2. When user enters password, that password is used to decrypt PK's.
3. But first, check that this decryption matches Data from #2. 
4. If True: sign, etc.
5. Else: throw error.

<strong>C) Max Attempts?</strong>
Should we delete/lock the wallet after X attempts?
Alternative: Store current time in a LockTime file, and if user tries
to log in before time in LockTime, app closes/rejects.

<strong>D) How should we do Front-end? </strong>
I think we should start with a command line only wallet, and then do this stuff.
Local Web browser? -Can we run Python from here?
Desktop App? -Can someone do this?
Mobile? -If Java is known
